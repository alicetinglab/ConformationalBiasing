# PDB Files

These PDB files were used for CB analysis in our manuscript. AlphaFold2 generated structures are denoted. In some cases, non-standard/modified amino acids were mutated back to the corresponding standard amino acids. A reference for all of these structures can be found in our [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.03.652001v3).
