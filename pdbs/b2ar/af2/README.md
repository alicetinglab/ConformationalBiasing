## AlphaFold2 generated B2-structures

These structures were generated using templated AlphaFold2, and used to improve coverage of the B2-AR structure. A pLDDT cutoff of 80 across all structures was used; positions not meeting this cutoff were not scored. Scores across each condition were then averaged for CB analysis. AlphaFold2 generated scores for these structures are included in this folder.
