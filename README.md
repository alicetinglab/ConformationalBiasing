# Design of conformational biasing mutations

Code based on ColabDesign/ProteinMPNN for designing mutations to bias protein conformational states. This repository is a work in progress. 

Workflow can also be run on Google Colaboratory [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hkBwsePRZnaHATNKskIwc1ayG72otU6C?usp=sharing).
