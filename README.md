# Design of conformational biasing mutations

Code based on ColabDesign/ProteinMPNN for designing mutations to bias protein conformational states. This repository is a work in progress. 

Workflow can also be run on Google Colaboratory for structures from PDB [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hkBwsePRZnaHATNKskIwc1ayG72otU6C?usp=sharing) or for custom structures [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qftE5uPRQuE8ZbQYmWp-MwVduJiot9I9).
